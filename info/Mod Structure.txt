/lua/common/*
	TimedTriggers.lua
		Is a library that can run in VE, GE and on the BeamMP lua server.
		Its essentially a high performance job library that allows queing rudimentary tasks and time sensitive executions.
		
	/mp_libs/*
		colors.lua
			Essentially a converter to display beammp chat color codes colored in a CUI (eg a beammp server cui)
		
		PauseTimer.lua
			A compatibility library that makes the hptimer()/HighPerfTimer() interface available in the beammp server. Wraps around either hptimer()/HighPerfTimer() or MP.CreateTimer()-
			When a library imports this it will be able to use stop()/stopAndReset()/start() no matter if in the games environment or a beammp server
			
/lua/ge/extensions/*
	DoNotTouch.lua
		The mods entrypoint. It loads and unloads everything relevant for this mod and doesnt do much else.
	
		/libs/*
			CollisionsLib.lua
				A so far unused library usable to detect "new" collisions between two vehicles.
			
			ForceField.lua
				Library that creates a highly customizable, radius based force field around any given vehicle. Where as highly customizable means that it works based on callbacks with defaults.
			
			MathUtil.lua
				Mostly covers things like "hey tell me how many cars are in this space", "hey rotate this vector for me", "hey check along this line if there have been vehicles". aka "the tedious math stuff"
			
			PowerUps.lua
				The core of this entire mod. Essentially only provides a definition, trait, sync and event system for powerups to use.
			
			PowerUpsExtender.lua
				Provides functions for vehicle and powerup interaction, mostly for the trait system. And a default powerup renderer.
				
			PowerUpsTraits.lua
				Defines the traits.
			
			Sets.lua
				A wrapper for the TimedTriggers.lua library. Pretty powerfull library in my mind that isnt much used yet. Essentially makes it possible to create sets of triggers that can be executed at any time along side various conditions.
			
			TriggerLoad.lua
				Think of the game own prefab loader, but dedicated to lua triggers only. Is a bare bones library.
			
			Util.lua
				Think of additional table functions, a better math.random etc
				
		/powerups/*
			Directory containing the powerup sets. If "open" is loaded into the powerups library it will consider all groups/powerups of that set
			
			/open/*
				The current default powerup set that is auto loaded if a map has a locations prefab available.
				
				Every .lua file in this folder represents a group of powerups. The folders the powerups of each group.

		/prefabs/*
			Directory containing location prefabs.
			if the level name matches a prefab name then its autoloaded.
			eg. "smallgrid.prefab.json" will be loaded on the "smallgrid" map

/lua/vehicle/extensions/auto/*
	PowerUpExtender.lua
		Provides extra ve utility.
	
	PowerUpSounds.lua
		Lib loading/storing/playing.. at vehicle locations. Either its me or the game sound engine is just buggy. This was giving me headaches. And there are still issues.
