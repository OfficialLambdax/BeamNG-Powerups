/lua/ge/extensions/*
	DoNotTouch.lua
		Entrypoint for the client side. It loads and unloads everything relevant for this mod and depending on if its a multiplayer session or not auto load locations and the "open" powerup set if its available for the map the player has loaded into.
		
	ServerSide.lua
		Entrypoint for the server side. All the contents of this "extensions" directory work client and server side. Copying this entire directory into a server will automatically load this mod as a server plugin.
		
		/libs/*
			CollisionsLib.lua
				A so far unused library usable to detect "new" collisions between two vehicles.
			
			ForceField.lua
				Library that creates a highly customizable, radius based force field around any given vehicle. Where as highly customizable means that it works based on callbacks with defaults.
				
			Log.lua
				Logging utility that also displays what threw the log as filename@luafunction:linenumber.
				Log.info("this is my log", nil/"name of this log", nil/true/false)
				If the 3rd arg is given it also prints a stack trace that shows the calling order. Which is just usefull to debug what called this function and what called that.
				eg.
				MyFile@MyFunction:linenumber
				 ^ AnotherFile@MyOtherFunction:linenumber
				 ^ etc
				
			MathUtil.lua
				Mostly covers things like "hey tell me how many cars are in this space", "hey rotate this vector for me", "hey check along this line if there have been vehicles". aka "the tedious math stuff"
			
			PowerUps.lua
				The core of this entire mod. Essentially only provides a definition, trait, sync and event system for powerups to use.
			
			PowerUpsExtender.lua
				Provides functions for vehicle and powerup interaction, mostly for the trait system. And a default powerup renderer.
				
			PowerUpsTraits.lua
				Defines the traits.
				
			PowerUpsTypes.lua
				Defines powerup group types.

			TimedTriggers.lua
				Is a library that can run in VE, GE and on the BeamMP lua server.
				Its essentially a high performance job library that allows queing rudimentary tasks and time sensitive executions.
			
			Sets.lua
				A wrapper for the TimedTriggers.lua library. Pretty powerfull library in my mind that isnt much used yet. Essentially makes it possible to create sets of triggers that can be executed at any time along side various conditions.
			
			TriggerLoad.lua
				Think of the game own prefab loader, but dedicated to lua triggers only. Is a bare bones library.
			
			Util.lua
				Think of additional table functions, a better math.random etc

		/mp_libs/*
			colors.lua
				Essentially a converter to display beammp chat color codes colored for a CUI (eg a beammp server cui)
			
			MPClientRuntime.lua
				Handles the multiplayer communication between the client and server from the client side.
				
			MPServerRuntime.lua
				Same but from the server side
			
			MPUtil.lua
				Wrapper for the BeamMP mod. Does checks and provides compatibility functions.
			
			PauseTimer.lua
				A compatibility library that makes the hptimer()/HighPerfTimer() interface available in the beammp server. Wraps around either hptimer()/HighPerfTimer() or MP.CreateTimer()
				When a library imports this it will be able to use stop()/stopAndReset()/start() no matter if in the games environment or a beammp server
				
			TriggerClientEvent.lua
				A better MP.TriggerClientEvent class
				
		/powerups/*
			Directory containing the powerup sets. If "open" is loaded into the powerups library it will consider all groups/powerups of that set
			
			/open/*
				The current default powerup set that is auto loaded if a map has a locations prefab available.
				
				Every .lua file in this folder represents a group of powerups. The folders the powerups of each group.

		/prefabs/*
			Directory containing location prefabs.
			if the level name matches a prefab name then its autoloaded.
			eg. "smallgrid.prefab.json" will be loaded on the "smallgrid" map

/lua/vehicle/extensions/auto/*
	PowerUpExtender.lua
		Provides extra ve utility.
	
	PowerUpSounds.lua
		Lib loading/storing/playing.. at vehicle locations. Either its me or the game sound engine is just buggy. This was giving me headaches. And there are still issues.
